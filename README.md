# lazy-route - Lazy route loading for React Router 4 through System.import

# Â :warning: **DEPRECATED**

There's a ton of great solutions for lazy loading now that simply do it better.
Here's a couple of options you should check out;

* https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component
* https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable

#### Dependencies and requirements

This component only works with React Router 4 and Webpack 2 (because of System.import).

#### Usage

Installation:

`npm install lazy-route` or `yarn add lazy-route`

How to use with React Router 4:

```javascript
import {Match} from 'react-router'
import LazyRoute from 'lazy-route'

<Match 
  pattern="/myroute"
  render={(props) => <LazyRoute {...props} component={import('./myComponent')} />}
/>
```

#### Upcoming features
The component works, but I have yet to add tests and some polish to it,
the plan is to add a customizable loader etc.
